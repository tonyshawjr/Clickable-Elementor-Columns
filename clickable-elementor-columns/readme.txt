Simple: allow users to click in the whole column instead of individual elements

== Description ==

Simple: allow users to click in the whole column instead of individual elements.

Users will be able to click in the whole column when you add a link on that.

= How to use it =

After install the plugin, open your Elementor editor, start editing a Column and under the Layout block you can add your custom link.

Works with any internal/external link, Lightbox and Elementor PRO popups trigger.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How this plugin Works? =

This plugin will add a custom URL field in each column of your Elementor editor. If you fill it, the column will be clickable.

Please note that the plugin works using JavaScript. So it's not an actual
&lt;a&gt; element. I do recommend you to also add the regular links on your inner elements for SEO and compatibility purposes. So you make sure that columns and default elements are working.
